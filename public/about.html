<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>Thank you for giving me this opportunity.</p>  
My name is Jonathan James, and I am 19 years old. I am from Ghatampur, Kanpur Nagar. My father's name is Mr. Jagram Singh, and my mother's name is Mrs. ManjuLata. I was born on 21st November 2005.

Currently, I am studying for my Bachelor of Computer Application at Dr. Virendra Swarup Institute of Computer Studies, Saket Nagar, Kanpur. Before that, I studied at Mother India Inter College, Ghatampur, where I scored 76% in 10th and 68% in 12th.

I am curious and always eager to learn, and I have a strong interest in technology. One thing I am working on is improving my confidence, as it is something I find challenging.

In my free time, I love editing and watching sci-fi movies, which I find interesting and fun.

My goal is to have a successful career in the field of technology in the near future.

That's a little about me.
<p>Thank you!
